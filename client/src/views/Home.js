                <h5>About me</h5>
                <p>
                    My name is Emmanuel Torres. I am from Honduras, and my native language is Spanish.
                    I am currently a Senior Software Engineer student enrolled in Snow College’s SE program,
                    expecting to get my degree this upcoming May of 2022.

                <h5>Background</h5>
                <p>
                    I am currently 21 years old, and I come from Honduras. My home town is called Danli, and is located in the Department of El Paraiso in Honduras.
                    Since I was in highschool, I always found computer programs to be interesting yet very mysterious.
                    Due to lack of access to proper resources, I never really got to understand how a computer program actually worked until I got to college.
                    In 2018, I found out about Snow college, and with the help of an advisor, I enrolled as a freshman that year, initially pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science.
                    The thing that motivated me to choose this specific field was that desire to understand software better.
                    After taking my first programming class, I realized that I liked programming a lot. I liked the challenge of taking an idea, and converting it into code that a computer can run.
                    After discovering that Snow had the Software Engineering program, I changed my major to SE, and I have been enjoying my time programming and overcoming the associated challenges ever since.

                <h5>Hobbies</h5>
                <p>
                    My favorite hobby is to play video games. In general, I love to play games that have an engaging story, and that have immersive worlds and characters.
                    Also, another hobby that I really love is mountain biking. I like how it feels to be outdoors, at the same time that I am cruising down a trail or dirt road.
                    I also enjoy the challenge of getting up the mountain by just pedaling up there. This makes the way down to feel more rewarding, and helps me to keep myself physically active.
                    Lastly, my last hobby is to play drums. Since I was a kid I was always intrigued about percussion in general, so when I got to play drums for the first time, I liked it very much.
                    Although I am not a great musician, I still have a good time when playing drums.
